## WELOCOME TO SOME OF MY COOL PROJECTS I MADE.
this includes a fully Functional AI and a calculator. 
You would need to set that up as u design the calculator
for my resolution

The Ai is very strong and can perform task like telling weather, news, opening apps and etc

#### Calculator

The calculator has a delete button and can perform all task a normal calculator can.

the design is bad sorry for that....

#### AI

To run my ai just type on your cmd:-
```bash
  python Ai.py
```
If you are on mack type if this shows error
```bash
  python3 Ai.py
```

#### Youtube video downloader
This can help you download and video or single audio or even a playlist using this


I also wrote some stupid commits as I can't think much on them
